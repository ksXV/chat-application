React Chat Application :
    -We will have a sign in / sign up feature where the user can sign in with their google account with firebase;
    -When the user will register they will be presented with 4 forms : 
                                                                    -email;
                                                                    -username/alias;
                                                                    -password;
                                                                    -confirm password ;
    -The chat will be one globaly momentarly and will display messages from everyone who sent a message in the chat : 
                -the user will type a message in the chat (e.g.: "Hello ,John!);
                -the message will be remembered in a local state ;
                -the message will be sent after to firestore with :
                                                                    - the user that sent it;
                                                                    - the date and hour that the message was sent;
                                                                    - the message itself;
